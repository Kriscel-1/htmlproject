    <h1>Quarter 1- Module 14: Illustrating Systems of Linear Equations in Two Variables</h1>
    <p>This module explores systems of linear equations in two variables. A system of equations consists of multiple linear equations that are simultaneously true, and solving such systems involves finding the values of the variables that satisfy all equations.</p>
    <p>Key topics covered in this module include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Understanding systems of linear equations and their solutions</li>
        <li>Classifying systems of equations based on their number of solutions</li>
        <li>Applying algebraic methods to solve systems of equations</li>
        <li>Graphical representation of systems of equations</li>
        <li>Interpreting the meaning of solutions to systems of equations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By mastering the concepts presented in this module, students will be able to effectively solve systems of linear equations, analyze their solutions, and apply their problem-solving skills to various mathematical and real-world scenarios.</p>
